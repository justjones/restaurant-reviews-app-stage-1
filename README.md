Udacity Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

This project is created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program. The project instructions were to take a static webpage and re-design it for responsive display. We were also instructed to add a service worker so that we can begin to set the application up for offline users.
